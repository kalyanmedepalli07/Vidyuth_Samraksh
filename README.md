We are often seeing that many of the people are losing Government Grants like 
Ammavadi, Ration Card, Pension, etc. According to these schemes, if the total power 
consumption of the house exceeds particular units per month, then the applicant for 
the scheme will fail to receive the benefits. The main problem behind this is, people are 
unaware of the cost of energy that is being consumed by various appliances, which is 
resulting in higher energy consumption, and higher electricity bills. In present existing 
system the main drawback of this system is that person has to go area by area and he 
has to read the meter of every house and handover the bills. Many times errors like 
extra bill amount, or notification from electric board even though the bills are paid are 
common errors and they can know their usage only after the person comes and reads
the meter. To overcome this problem, we have come up with an idea “Vidyuth 
Samraksh”, which intimates the user with an SMS when a certain threshold is reached.
In this epics project, the idea of "Vidyuth Samraksh" using IoT, Arduino, and GSM has 
been introduced. Arduino ATMEGA328 is used here because it is energy efficient i.e., it 
consumes less power, and it is the fastest. Energy meters which are already installed at 
our houses are not replaced, but a small modification on the already installed meters is 
made so that we can achieve our aim. The GSM module provides a feature of sending a 
notification through an SMS. One can view their daily usage which is updated in 
ThingSpeak Cloud API. Current readings with cost can be seen on the ThingSpeak 
website or in the ThingView App anytime. Users will start receiving the message 
notifications once the threshold is about to reach.
